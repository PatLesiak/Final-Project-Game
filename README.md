# Final-Project-Game

I have decided to take a shot on developing my first game using pygame module.
Games are something which sometimes help me relax after stressful live matters.

Pygame tutorial i have found helped me understand python basics and more advanced functions while having a great time.

I learned how to manipulate code using objective programming with strong presence of classes usage in my project.

Game is really simple and very easy to make changes to 'balance' it to maximize fun.

Game development is quite fun and interactive way to learn programming language.

My project required pygame module to run properly.
